"""
Given three ints, a b c, return True if one of b or c is "close"
(differing from a by at most 1),
while the other is "far", differing from both other values by 2 or more.
Note: abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.

close_far(1, 2, 10) → True
close_far(1, 2, 3) → False
close_far(4, 1, 3) → True

    a_c_diff = abs(a - c)
    b_c_diff = abs(b - c)

    return (
        (a_b_diff <= 1 and a_c_diff >= 2 and b_c_diff >= 2) !=
